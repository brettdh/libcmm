*** TODO ***

* Implement IROB API
  * IROB traffic decoration at sender
  * IROB header stripping, buffering, etc. at receiver
* Implement send ops as anonymous IROBs

* Implement opaque send failure
   (i.e. if a send fails, automatically retry, thunking/blocking
    as appropriate)

* Switch over from signal-based IPC to pure message passing
   (This involves a dedicated IPC thread in the lib.
    The thread will be responsible for waking up blocking
    operations as networks come up and for spawning/managing
    worker threads that execute thunks.)

* Implement multi-threaded receiver subsystem
  * One thread per csocket
  * One scheduler thread per multi-socket

* Implement thread that listens for connections on internal listener socket
  * Maybe the receiver thread can have this job?
    * But that thread is blocking on its message queue.
  * Probably makes sense to have a dedicated thread that just selects
    on the listener socket in a loop.
