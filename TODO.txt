*** TODO ***

* (DONE)Implement IROB API
  * (DONE) App-facing functions
  * (DONE) IROB traffic decoration at sender
  * (DONE) IROB header stripping, buffering, etc. at receiver
* (DONE) Implement send ops as anonymous IROBs

* (DONE) Implement opaque send failure
   (i.e. if a send fails, automatically retry, thunking/blocking
    as appropriate)

* (DONE) Switch over from signal-based IPC to pure message passing
   (This involves a dedicated IPC thread in the lib.
    The thread will be responsible for spawning/managing
    worker threads that execute thunks.)
   (Update: actually, all we need is one thread that reads from the 
    message queue, calling into the code that updates the interfaces
    map and fires thunks as appropriate.)
  * (DONE) Make sure this is thread-safe. (Tenative conclusion: it is.)

* (DONE) Implement multi-threaded receiver subsystem
  * (DONE) One thread per csocket
  * (DONE) One scheduler thread per multi-socket

* (DONE) Implement thread that listens for connections on internal listener socket
  * Maybe the receiver thread can have this job?
    * But that thread is blocking on its message queue.
  * (DONE) Probably makes sense to have a dedicated thread that just selects
           on the listener socket in a loop.


* Implement recv, blocking and ordering incoming bytes according to
  dependency information.

* Make it all compile!
