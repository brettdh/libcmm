* Think about and write up a list of sensible ways to handle failures:
  * where all physical connections are broken, but interfaces
    are still available to connect on
  * where all physical connections are broken and no connections are possible

  * ALSO, think about this in terms of the following options for 
    failure notification:
    1) The application wants to ignore failure
    2) The application wants to be notified immediately
    3) The application wants to be notified after a timeout


1) Scenario: The app wants to send bytes with label X, and a suitable 
             network is available now.
     Result: The bytes are sent, and the call returns successfully.

2) Scenario: The app wants to send bytes with label X, but no suitable
             network is currently available.  The application provided
             a thunk with this call.
     Result: The thunk is registered and the call returns DEFERRED.
             The thunk will be called when a suitable network becomes
             available.

3) Scenario: 2), except that the application did not provide a thunk.
     Result: We could imagine one of the following:
             a) The operation returns failure immediately.
             b) The operation blocks indefinitely, until a suitable network
                becomes available.
             c) Same as b), but with an application-provided timeout.

   Presumably, different applications might wish to choose among these
   behaviors rather than being forced into any one of them.  How, then,
   should we allow the application to make this choice?

   First crack at this (not quite right):
     - b) is the default.
     - The application can get a) by using the O_NONBLOCK fcntl or by 
       using the MSG_DONTWAIT send flag.
     - The application can get c) by using blocking I/O and setting
       the SO_SNDTIMEO socket option.
   Positives of this approach:
     - It leverages interfaces that already exist.
   Why is it not quite right?
     - It hijacks the common meaning of "non-blocking I/O."  The application
       may want immediate failure notification but blocking I/O for sends
       that can succeed now.
