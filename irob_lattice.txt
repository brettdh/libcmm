* Anonymous IROBs depend on the domset of in-flight IROBs.
* All IROBs depend on all anonymous IROBs that happened-before them.
  * It's sufficient to just depend on the most recent anonymous IROB, since it
     transitively depends on everything that happened-before it.
* All of this is enforced at the receiver.  However,
* The sender-side needs to have the same info for scheduling decisions.
   * An IntSet of past IROBs should be at the sender too.

From the lattice, I need:
  * A way to add IROBs and have their deps automatically added. (correct_deps)
  * A way to pick released IROBs to pass to the application (this can be simple for now)
  * A way to change scheduling/labeling based on dependency information (can come later)

None of these require a pointerful lattice structure for functionality 
(but maybe for performance).
