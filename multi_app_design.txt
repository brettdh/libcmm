Goals for multi-app interaction witn Intentional Networking

1) FG/BG should be enforced across all running IN apps
   * Should likewise be applied between multisockets in same app
   * Simple test
     - 2 apps; one only sends FG, one only sends BG
     - FG app waits for a while, so that BG traffic gets flowing fast
     - FG performance should start slow, then quickly improve
     - Repeat with two multisockets in one app

2) FG traffic in different IN apps should compete fairly for the network

3) IN apps and non-IN apps should compete fairly for the network


Design

1) Currently, there's a per-interface-pair timestamp of the last FG transmission.
2) We'll make this per-local-interface and stick the value in shared memory, 
   which all IN processes can read/write.
3) Reading/writing the timestamp must be atomic.
